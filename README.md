# FeedForward
FeedForward is a food donation platform built using the MERN stack, designed to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need. The platform enables donors to share excess food, recipients to request food. QR codes and email notifications streamline the food distribution process.

## Features

### 1. **Multiple user roles**:
- **Admin**: Assigns city admins to different cities.
- **City Admin**: Verifies and approves recipients who wish to join the platform.
- **Donor**: Posts surplus food or fulfills recipient food requests.
- **Recipient**: Requests available food from donors or requests food requests based on their needs.

### 2. **QR Code Verification**: 
- Once a donation is made, a QR code is generated and sent via email to the donor. The recipient must scan this QR code to mark the donation as completed.

### 3. **Email Notifications**:
- Donors receive alerts about recipient requests.
- Recipients are notified about available food.
- Both parties receive confirmation emails regarding donation transactions.

### 4. **Authentication & Security**: 
- JWT-based authentication with ***protected routes*** on both frontend and backend.

### 5. **Effective API Handling**: 
- React Query is used for efficient API calls.
